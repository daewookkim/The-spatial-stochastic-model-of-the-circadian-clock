NetLogo code to simulate the effect of the cytoplasmic congestion in the mammalian circadian clock. Please see the info panel of the code for further description of the model.


This model was extended from the previous mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock (Kim et al., 2012, MSB). To investigate the effect of the crowdedness of cytoplasmic contents on the circadina clock, this model was developed.

The model simulation suggests that the spatial regulation of PER protein, the repressor of the circadian clock, leads to its sharp switch-like phosphorylation and thus sharp nuclear translocation. This nonlinear nuclear entry plays the critial role in generating the robust circadian rhythms. Please see Beesley et al., for details description of the model.
